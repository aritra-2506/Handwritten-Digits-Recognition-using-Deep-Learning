# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
Uses MNIST Dataset - Grayscale images, balanced dataset and loading data directly

Three different types of scripts are there. 

First one includes training a CNN on MNIST dataset and doing results evaluation.
Second one includes training a CNN on MNIST dataset using data augmentation.
Third one includes training a CNN on MNIST dataset making use of hyperparameter optimization.
Fourth one incudes third one and evaluation.
